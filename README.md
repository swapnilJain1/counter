**React Component Showcase: **
A simple React application that demonstrates three different interactive components: a colored box, an automatic loading bar, and a manual counter. This project serves as a practical example of React state management, conditional rendering, and effect hooks.


1. Colored Box: Displays a box that changes color when selected

2. Automatic Loading Bar: Shows a progress bar that automatically fills up to 100%

3. Manual Counter: Provides a counter that can be manually incremented and decremented
